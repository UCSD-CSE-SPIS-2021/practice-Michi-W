# practice-Michi-W

Hi, I'm Michi. I am from San Diego, CA. I am hoping to learn python and to meet many new people. I'm don't know many board games, but I am currently into a wargame called warhammer 40k (it would be nice to know others who play it, but I'm not expecting it because of its high learning curve)
